### League Overview
The Inebriation of Confederation was established in 2011 by a group of 10 free-spirited young men, hell bent on fantasy glory and alcohol consumption. Over the years the Confederation has grown to 12 mature responsible adults..
...still hell bent on fantasy glory and alcohol consumption. It is a Confederation filled with personality, competition, and, most importantly, respect. Faced by Commissioner Gordon, and run by PEDGE, the Conderferation is stronger than ever. The 2017 season is shaped to be a classic, with many questions to be answered. 

Will milk begin to curd or remain creamier than ever? Will Gordon finally win a championship? Will Ben crack 80 points in a single week? Will the Ghost return to his old form? Will Dune send a message in GroupMe? Will Tross finish the season with a single drafted player? Will Poppy finally admit his allegiance to PEDGE? Will the Shepherd rise to greatness once again? Will Richard remain mediocre? Stay tuned.
