### Returns by Season
The table below shows the draft results for the selected GM for the given season, along with each drafted player's  projected fantasy points at the start of the season and the actual fantasy points scored for that season. The return is calculated as measure of deviation from the preseason expectation. Projected points generally decline as the round decreases, which means a 10% return on your first round pick is significantly better than a 10% return on your 8th round pick. The return Commish earned on Ezekiel last season is what we all strive for. Use the drop down boxes above to analyze different GMs and seasons.
