### Ron "Commissioner Gordon" Remi
**Hometown:** Massapequa  
**Record:** 35 - 30  
**Skill:** Dysphagia  

In true blind leading the blind fashion, Commissioner Gordon is the patriarch of this beloved Confederation. He has a comparable playoff history to the Buffalo Bills of the early 90s. When Commish isn't at GoodLife, he can be found staring at his ceilings into the wee hours of the night wondering; "Why can't I win the big one?"
