### Jack "The Dunne Squad" Dunn
**Hometown:** Massapequa  
**Record:** 30 - 35  
**Skill:** Liberalism

Jack is widely considered as the "Token Liberal" of the Confederation. Although he is virtually non-existent in the GroupMe, his spirit lives on when People's Champ decides to take on his persona every so often. Jack has had a [simple](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-lYIdDfwuVUE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADo/JTr_FJQK6aI/photo.jpg) life in the Inebo. He's not quite a bottom feeder, but he also hasn't dealt with the stresses that come along with a playoff run. Jack is a beloved member of the Inebo, even if he would rather take people's hard working money, and allocate it to his fellow Socialists.
